        comment: "Cleaned up requirements.txt to remove problematic packages that caused DigitalOcean deployment failures (jq, spacy, dev tools, etc.). Removed DigitalOcean-specific files (app.yaml, Dockerfiles, .python-version). Created Railway-specific configuration files: Procfile for start command, package.json for mono-repo support, railway.toml for Railway configuration, nixpacks.toml for build configuration. Prepared clean deployment ready for Railway platform with simplified dependencies."
