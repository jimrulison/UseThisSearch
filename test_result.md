        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION COMPLETED - ALL CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING: ✅ Health Check: API server responding correctly with healthy status. ✅ User Authentication: Registration and login system working perfectly, JWT tokens generated successfully. ✅ Search Functionality with Claude AI: Core search feature working, Claude AI integration generating 55+ keyword suggestions in ~14 seconds, all required response fields present. ✅ Admin Authentication: Admin login working, protected analytics endpoints accessible with proper authentication. ✅ Billing/Stripe Integration: Pricing configuration accessible with 9 pricing plans, billing endpoints responding correctly. ✅ Trial System: 7-day trial system fully functional, proper day/search tracking, trial status API working. ✅ Keyword Clustering Access Controls: Access control system working correctly, properly restricting premium features to appropriate subscription tiers. CRITICAL VERIFICATION: No essential dependencies were accidentally removed during requirements.txt cleanup. All core systems (authentication, search, billing, admin, trial) are fully operational. The cleaned requirements.txt contains only production-essential packages: FastAPI ecosystem, database drivers (pymongo/motor), authentication libraries (JWT/bcrypt), Claude AI integration (anthropic), Stripe billing, and core data processing libraries. Railway deployment is READY with full functionality verified."
